    <p>This is a quick demo of some drawbacks of non-hash-based routing</p>
    <p>Whenever a <em>popstate</em> or <em>hashchange</em> event is triggered, a notification will show up at the bottom of the page.</p>
    <p>Try clicking links on the page. Also try clicking the Forward and Back buttons of your browser.</p>
    <p>Notice that you get both <em>popstate</em> and <em>hashchange</em> every time you navigate.</p>
